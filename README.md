# Pandemic-Control-Measures-and-Analysis-using-computer-vision

Abstractâ€” Objects are commonplace, and we intuitively understand their purpose and
objectives. We know a coffee cup is a cup by how it looks, and we can differentiate an empty
one from a filled one just from a glance. Championing this idea forward with new-age
technologies, we create a system to detect and sort the status of objects. We custom tailor
our model to quantify pandemic control measures such as face mask usage and 
socialdistancing protocols using computer vision.

For face mask usage, we detect various facial landmarks and correlate them with face mask
position to accurately determine the different states of wearing a mask in real-time and
provide analytics on overall face mask usage.

For social-distancing protocols, we detect and count pedestrians in a controlled space from a
forty-five-degree angled top-down camera, determine if they are in line with official norms in
real-time, and provide statistics on the status of social distancing in a specific area to inspire
reformative changes. We aim to contribute to control measures and analysis using computer
vision regarding the pandemic.
